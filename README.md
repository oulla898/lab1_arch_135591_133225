# CPU Performance Calculator

## Introduction

This lab project aims to compare the performance of several CPUs using different benchmarks. It addresses the challenge of comparing CPU performances across various benchmarks by utilizing both arithmetic and geometric means of speed metrics. This approach provides a more accurate representation of performance, especially when dealing with outliers or extreme values.

## Features

- Web-based interface for easy data input
- Supports multiple processors and benchmarks
- Calculates speed metrics, arithmetic mean, and geometric mean
- Ranks processors based on performance
- Hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access

## Formulas Used

1. Speed Metric: 1 / (Execution Time / Reference Execution Time)
2. Arithmetic Mean of Speed Metrics: Sum of Speed Metrics / Number of Benchmarks
3. Geometric Mean of Speed Metrics: nth root of the product of n Speed Metrics

## Usage

1. Access the calculator at: [CPU Performance Calculator](https://oulla898.github.io/lab1_arch_135591_133225/cpu_performance_calculator.html)
2. Fill in the execution times for each processor and benchmark
3. Select a reference processor
4. View the calculated results and rankings

## Implementation

The project is implemented using HTML and JavaScript. The HTML file defines the structure of the web page, while the JavaScript file handles the calculations and updates the results dynamically.

### Key Components:

- HTML table for data input
- JavaScript functions for calculations
- Dynamic result display

## Results

The calculator provides:
- Speed metrics for each processor and benchmark
- Arithmetic and geometric means of speed metrics
- Overall ranking of processors

Manual calculations were performed to verify the accuracy of the website's results, and they were found to be consistent.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates an effective method for comparing CPU performances across multiple benchmarks. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting data and viewing results, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical users. The use of both arithmetic and geometric means offers a more comprehensive view of processor performance.
